    "### What is Emoji2Vec?\n",
    "Emoji2Vec representations are a form of distributed representations for Unicode emojis, trained directly from natural language descriptions of emojis. <br>\n",
    "This notebook presents a high level walkthrough the process of training Emoji2Vec representations and demonstrates some experimental results. <br><br>\n",
    "First, lets define the logical steps in training Emoji2Vec representations.\n",
    "1. For each emoji in a data set a number of natural language descriptions is collected.\n",
    "2. Each description is encoded to a fixed form vector in a high dimensional space. \n",
    "    - Although it can be done by an arbitrary encoding method, this implementation follows the approach presented in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08359.pdf) using 300-dimensional [Google News word2vec embeddings](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) together with a simple phrase encoder `phrase2vec.Phrase2Vec`.\n",
    "3. A neural network model is trained to classify emojis from their descriptions.\n",
    "    - Inside the model each unique emoji has its own vector of parameters that is updated when this emoji is being classified. Through continuous incrementation in training such vectors of parameters become emoji representations.\n",
    "4. Neural network's parameters are extracted and used as distributed emoji representations that are embedded in the same space as the underlying word embeddings."
